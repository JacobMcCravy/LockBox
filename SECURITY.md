## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability in LockBox, please:

1. **DO NOT** open a public issue
2. Email: nimbastrator@gmail.com
3. Include:
   - What you found
   - How to reproduce it
   - Potential impact

We'll work with you to fix it before any public disclosure.

## Security Best Practices

- Keep your `.env` file secure - it contains your encryption keys
- Use a strong master password
- Backup your database and `.env` file regularly
- Keep dependencies updated

Thank you for helping keep LockBox secure!
